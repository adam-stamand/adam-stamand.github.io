                        My time in the Marine Corps had prepared me to take full advantage of my
                        time at the University of Colorado. I had been taught that you get out what
                        you put in, and I knew this to be particularly true at university. I was very 
                        fortunate to be attending a university that had such diversity; in experience,
                        challenges, and people. 
                        <br><br>During my three years I worked as a research assistant, played
                        saxophone in the jazz band, trained with the triathlon team, become lead engineer of a 
                        satellite project, and ultimately learned how to manage my time (without 
                        a surpervising Sergeant). The Marine Corps taught discipline, initiative and  
                        motivation; University gave me an opportunity to apply it.

                            Europa Clipper will gather important data about one of Jupiter's icy moons, Europa, investigating
                            it's potential to harbor conditions suitable for human life. The mission will launch a satellite into
                            Jupiter's orbit, allowing the spacecraft to flyby and collect data from Europa.
                            
                            <br><br>My role on the project as an embedded flight software engineer has been to develop the software
                            running on the main flight compute elements (a redundant set of flight computers). Working in a team
                            of nearly 30 software engineers, we were tasked with not only developing software for the Europa Clipper
                            mission, but developing a software product that could be easily repurposed for future missions. 
                            We used a space-time partitioned operating system (Greenhills Integrity), introducing modularity
                            and safety, but adding complexity due to the introduction of partitions and virtual address spaces.

                                <br><br>My role on the team as an embedded flight software engineer was to develop driver level
                                software to enable interfacing with hardware. I worked on a team of about 8 other 
                                software engineers tasked with desining a modular software framework called F-Prime. This
                                framework was designed as a product to enable quick development of small satellite missions,
                                but also as a tool to be used by the public. The framework is open source and currently on 
                                GitHub. 

                                <br><br>I was also fortunate enough to get to help with the hardware design of the flight 
                                computer. As part of the hardware team, I and three other engineers worked to design and test
                                the Sphinx board, again designed to be resused by future projects.

                                    avionics engineer, responsible for all hardware and software on the 
                                    satellite avionics bus. 

                                    <br><br>It was an amazing and necessary experience for me, as it resulted
                                    in me knowing exactly what I wanted to do with me career. It was
                                    in this project that I developed a passion for the intersection between
                                    hardware and software. I experienced what it's like working with a 
                                    small, tight knit team in which every member is equally passionate
                                    about accomplishing the mission. From the late night meals to 
                                    the occasional overnights in the lab, I learned more about engineering
                                    there than anywhere else; technically, personally, and professionally.

                                        a drone deployment system capable of surveiling wild fires. The mission
                                        inhereted a drone from a previous team.

                                        <br><br>I was tasked with providing autonomous operation capability for the drone, all the way
                                        from takeoff to landing. I was also taksed with implementing autonomous charging
                                        capability for the drone, in order to extend the life of each deployment.

                                        <!-- <br><br>Autonomous flight was fairly simple in most stages except for landing.
                                        In order to land on a precise target, after much trial and error, ended up with 
                                        a design similar to that used in industry robotics; Augmented Reality Tags. Autonomous
                                        charging was acheived using careful hardware design and Texas Instruments battery

                                        <p>
                                            I spent a year working with Dr. Jeffrey Parker and his research team in order to demonstrate
                                            the efficacy of HDTV signals as a source of navigation for spacecraft. Currently GPS can be used
                                            for spacecraft that remain below the GPS orbit (Medium Earth Orbit), or the Deep Space Network (DSN) can
                                            be used for traveling beyond, but there are not many alternative technologies available. 

                                            <br><br>HDTV signals are signals that are broadcast by terrestrial towers, intended to transfer TV data to 
                                            customers. But, not all of the engery that these towers broadcast stay on near the surface. Due to inherit imperfections
                                            in the radiation pattern of these towers, some of the signal radiates towards space. Using some of the synchonization
                                            data within these broadcasts, as well as some other a priori information, you can determine position in space with
                                            an accuracy of a few 100 meters.

                                            <br><br> I was responsible for determining if the signals from the sidelobes of the HDTV towers was strong enough
                                            to be used for spacecraft navigation. I did so by preparing a payload for a high altitude balloon flight. By collecting
                                            data at various angles of inclination relative to the towers, I was able to determine the radiation pattern of the towers.
                                            Once the pattern was known, it was just a matter of applying formulas to determine the signal strength at distance.

                                            I served one enlistment in the United States Marine Corps. During that time, I learned
                                            not only the typical military skills (firearms, hand-to-hand combat, leadership, etc),
                                            I learned many of the skills that are essential to personal success, like how to 
                                            take initiative, how to be prepared, and how to maintain integrity. And it's for those 
                                            skills that I consider the Marine Corps to be an essential experience for my personal 
                                            development.

                                            <br><br>I first shipped out to bootcamp in San Diego, where I enjoyed a 3-month, expenses paid 
                                            summer vacation. Myself and the other recruits would go out for jogs in the morning 
                                            with our camp counselors/Drill Instructors. Afterword, the days were filled with fun
                                            activities ranging from casualty evactuation drills to urban combat training, and even
                                            some one on one training with the Drill Instructors.

                                            <br><br>After training, I was stationed in New Orleans, LA where I began working under my
                                            Military Ocupation Specialty, a bandsmen. A saxohpone player to be precise. I spent the following
                                            three years encountering some of my most challenging moments, and developing
                                            some of the closest bonds that I am likely to ever. Semper Fi.

                                                My enlistment in the Marine Corps was a transformative experience. I learned the
                                                typical military skills; how to shoot a rifle, how to wake up early, how to survive
                                                stringent physical conditions. But the most important lessons I gained from my time
                                                in the Corps I actually didn't learn until I got out. Once I was on my own, free to
                                                do as I may, that's when I came to realize the necesitty of all those qualities the 
                                                Marine Corps (forced onto me[fix]). 
                                                
                                                <br><br>Preparation to ensure success, initiative to 
                                                acheive in the absence of direction, integrity to maintain trust. After leaving
                                                the Marine Corps, I then had a choice whether to uphold these values and practice the
                                                skills I had been trained in.  And at times, I did not, and in those moments it became painfully
                                                clear to me how essential those Marine Corps qualities are. As I navigated the 
                                                civilian world the
