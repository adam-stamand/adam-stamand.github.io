                                My time in the Marine Corps had prepared me to take full advantage of my
                                time at the University of Colorado. I had been taught that you get out what
                                you put in, and I knew this to be particularly true at university. I was very 
                                fortunate to be attending a university that had such diversity; in experience,
                                challenges, and people. 
                                <br><br>During my three years I worked as a research assistant, played
                                saxophone in the jazz band, trained with the triathlon team, become lead engineer of a 
                                satellite project, and ultimately learned how to manage my time (without 
                                a supervising Sergeant). The Marine Corps taught discipline, initiative and  
                                motivation; University gave me an opportunity to apply it.

                                The Payload Integration and Control Unit (PICU) is a satellite subsystem designed to act as a payload hub, sitting
                                between the satellite bus and multiple satellite payloads. The mission of the PICU is to enable the excution of several
                                missions across several different payloads, all onboard one satellite. It does so by managing bus resource allocation, scheduling
                                payload operations, handling command and data, all while providing customers access to their payloads in real-time. The PICU
                                is implemented as a cluster of distributed nodes, allowing for redundancy as well as load balancing for more demanding
                                computation.

                                <br><br> As a senior developer on the PICU software team, I designed/implemented many of the critical functionalities of the PICU, 
                                such as the hearbeat/state of health broadcasting system, the CCSDS Space Packet communications stack, the time synchronization
                                mechanisms (utilizing pulse per second hardware), and more. I also wrote and maintained a scripting suite in python to enable
                                the scalable configuration and generation of missions in arbitrary setups (the cluster of distributed nodes changes between 
                                missions). 
                                
                                <br><br> I also designed and developed an open source message-oriented middleware to replace the proprietary (and difficult to use)
                                framework that had originally been used for the PICU. This middleware was built off of ZMQ, and enabled users to create arbitrary
                                and scalable mesh networks of peers. Peers can then communicate with each other using three messaging patterns: Pub/Sub, 
                                Request/Reply, and Push/Pull. The project is called the

                                of nearly 30 software engineers, we were tasked with not only developing software for the Europa Clipper
                                mission, but developing a software product that could be easily repurposed for future missions. 
                                We used a space-time partitioned operating system (Greenhills Integrity), introducing modularity
                                and safety, but adding complexity due to the introduction of partitions and virtual address spaces.

                                The Lunar Flashlight mission will use a 6U cubesat and cutting edge green propulsion to
                                be the first cubesat to reach the moon, as well as be the first mission to use lasers to 
                                search for water ice. 
                                
                                <br><br>My role on the team as an embedded flight software engineer was to develop driver level
                                software to enable interfacing with hardware. I worked on a team of about 8 other 
                                software engineers tasked with designing a modular software framework called F-Prime. This
                                framework was designed as a product to enable quick development of small satellite missions,
                                but also as a tool to be used by the public. The framework is open source and currently on 
                                GitHub. 

                                <br><br>I was also fortunate enough to get to help with the hardware design of the flight 
                                computer. As part of the hardware team, I and three other engineers worked to design and test
                                the Sphinx board, again designed to be reused by future projects.

                            <p>
                                I spent a year working with Dr. Jeffrey Parker and his research team in order to demonstrate
                                the efficacy of HDTV signals as a source of navigation for spacecraft. Currently GPS can be used
                                for spacecraft that remain below the GPS orbit (Medium Earth Orbit), or the Deep Space Network (DSN) can
                                be used for traveling beyond, but there are not many alternative technologies available. 

                                <br><br>HDTV signals are signals that are broadcast by terrestrial towers, intended to transfer TV data to 
                                customers. But, not all of the energy that these towers broadcast stay on near the surface. Due to inherit imperfections
                                in the radiation pattern of these towers, some of the signal radiates towards space. Using some of the synchronization
                                data within these broadcasts, as well as some other a priori information, you can determine position in space with
                                an accuracy of a few 100 meters.

                                <br><br> I was responsible for determining if the signals from the side lobes of the HDTV towers was strong enough
                                to be used for spacecraft navigation. I did so by preparing a payload for a high altitude balloon flight. By collecting
                                data at various angles of inclination relative to the towers, I was able to determine the radiation pattern of the towers.
                                Once the pattern was known, it was just a matter of applying formulas to determine the signal strength at distance.

                                I served one enlistment in the United States Marine Corps. During that time, I learned
                                not only the typical military skills (firearms, hand-to-hand combat, leadership, etc),
                                I learned many of the skills that are essential to personal success, like how to 
                                take initiative, how to be prepared, and how to maintain integrity. And it's for those 
                                skills that I consider the Marine Corps to be an essential experience for my personal 
                                development.

                                <br><br>I first shipped out to boot camp in San Diego, where I enjoyed a 3-month, expenses paid 
                                summer vacation. Myself and the other recruits would go out for jogs in the morning 
                                with our camp counselors/Drill Instructors. Afterword, the days were filled with fun
                                activities ranging from casualty evacuation drills to urban combat training, and even
                                some one on one training with the Drill Instructors.

                                <br><br>After training, I was stationed in New Orleans, LA where I began working under my
                                Military Occupation Specialty, a bandsmen. A saxophone player to be precise. I spent the following
                                three years encountering some of my most challenging moments, and developing
                                some of the closest bonds that I am likely to ever. Semper Fi.
