            <h1 data-aos="example-anim3">The Origins</h1>
            <p data-aos="example-anim3"> I was raised in a military family, specifically, a Marine Corps family. My parents met while they were
                serving in 29 Palms, CA; my Mom as an electrician and my father as an explosive ordinance disposal technician.
                They travelled the world having three boys along the way (the youngest of which is myself), 
                and eventually settling down in Elizabth, CO, after my father retired from the Marine Corps. 
            
            <h1 data-aos="example-anim3">Back to School</h1>
            <p data-aos="example-anim3"> By the time my father retired I was just entering middle school.
                During my time in middle and high school, I developed a love of music; jazz to be precise. I played saxophone
                in the school bands eventually making it into the all-state ensembles. I had aspirations to become a professional 
                jazz musician, though I (and especially my mother) had concerns about the standard of living that might lead to.
                One night before my senior year of high school my mother mentioned to me that the military branches have bands, and
                suggested I look into them as a way to pursue music. In a matter of days I had auditioned and signed up for the Marine 
                Corps.
            
            <h1 data-aos="example-anim3">Semper Fi</h1>
            <p data-aos="example-anim3"> My time in the Marine Corps was really special to me. I learned how to conduct myself, what it means to lead others,
                and how to set/achieve goals. I had joined to be a musicain, but by the end of my enlistment I just wanted to be 
                a Marine. But despite my love of the Corps, I had decided it best to get out and begin life as a civilian. I had
                almost no idea what I wanted to do, though I had a pretty clear idea of what I didn't want to do. Communications,
                political science, nothing of the like interested me. After reviewing the available majors, I knew I had to be 
                a computer engineer.
            
            <h1 data-aos="example-anim3">Go Buffs</h1>
            <p data-aos="example-anim3"> I applied to only one school; University of Colorad, Boulder. I had a gut feeling that it was where I was meant to be
                and so I put all my effort into it. Once accepted, I began studying computer engineering. As I learned in the Marine
                Corps, what you get out of something is entirely up to you. I knew that making the most of my time at University was
                my responsibilty. I quickly joined as many engineering clubs as I could, searching for a place that I could develop
                myself as an engineer. By the end of my first semester, I had joined the SpaceGrant program at CU Boulder. As 
                part of this program, I joined the PolarCube Team, a team of about 20 engineering students workign to build a 3U
                cubesat, in order to fly a mini-radiometer in low earth orbit. I fell in love with the work, the people, and embedded 
                systems all in the 2.5 years I spent on that project. By the time I was getting ready to graduate, I knew exactly 
                what I wanted to do with my life. 
            
                
            <h1 data-aos="example-anim3">Rocket Science</h1>
            <p data-aos="example-anim3"> My time in university provided me with the experience and expertise to thrive as an embedded systems engineer,
                particularly in aerospace. I applied and interviewed with several companies as I approached graduation, none of which
                seemed as attractive an opportunity as the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. I was given an offer as an embedded flight
                software engineer, gladly accepted, and moved to Los Angeles, CA. I've been here for about 2 years, and haven't looked 
                back.

            <h1 data-aos="example-anim3">Moving Forward</h1>
            <p data-aos="example-anim3"> What matters most to me is being around good people, doing good work. I don't know where
                the next chapter of my life will take me, but I'm going to continue to pursue those two things. I've been
                blessed with friends and family to support me through my endevors thus far, and with their continued support
                I'm ready for whatever life gives me and where ever it takes me!

            <h1>How it all began</h1>
            <p>My parents met while they were both serving in the Marine Corps; my
            mother an electrician and my father working in explosive ordinance disposal. My mother served
            one enlistment, later becoming a recreational therapist while my father remained in the Marine Corps
            for 24 years until his retirement. During this time my folks moved all around the world, eventually having
            three children, the youngest of which is myself. After my father's retirement, my family moved to Elizabeth, Colorado,
            where my father continued disposing of explosive ordinance as a civilian, and my brothers and I finished primary school.
        <div class="page-content">
            <h1>To Colorado..</h1>
            <p>Shortly after moving to Colorado, I (through little choice of my own) ended up playing in my middle school band. After 
            being given a short opportunity to try each instrument, I was determined to be a drummer. After failing the audition 
            in order to be a drummer, I defaulted to the alto saxophone. Once I had gotten over the dissapointement of my rhythmic 
            shortcomings, I actually began to enjoy the saxophone, and music more generally, very much. So much so, that by the time 
            I had reached high school (to my mother's dismay) I was determined to be a professional jazz musician.
        <div class="page-content">
            <h1>Joining The Marine Corps</h1>
            <p>
            One night at the family dinner table, my mother concerned for my potentially meek future as a musician, suggested looking
            into the military bands. I had no idea at the time, but each military branch has several bands each, largely for 
            ceremonial and recruiting purposes. I was always intruiged by the idea of joining the military and after only a few 
            days' research, I was on a new path; I was to be a Marine Corps Musician. Before beginning my senior year of high school,
            I had passed the audition. All that was left was to graduate high school, and then I was off to bootcamp.
        <div class="page-content">
            <h1>Semper Fi</h1>
            <p>
            After a 4 month stint at the Naval School of Music in Virginia, I was stationed in New Orleans, Louisiana as part of 
            Headquarters Battalion, 4th Marine Division. It was there that I really began to develop into an adult. With my
            family and friends a thousand miles away, I was faced with challenges and responsibilities I could not have imagined
            before joining the Marine Corps. Contraty to what I had imagined happening, I grew a love and passion for the Marine 
            Corps, but a disdain for professional music. I quickly realized that mixing an artistic passion with work made for 
            a tricky lifestyle. The balance between personal expression and mandated business is a difficult one to strike, and 
            one that I no longer had interest in obtaining.

                <h1>Transitioning Out</h1>
                <p>
                During my time in the Marine Corps, I had dablled with some basic programming. Things like Visual Basic for Excel macros,
                or simple python scripts to perform basic calculations. I was by no means a computer wiz, but as I was transitioning out
                of the Marine Corps, I knew I had to develop a useful skill and preferrably one that I enjoyed applying. I  -->
